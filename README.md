# QA:
**If you are the owner of an APP,How to detect if you donâ€™t want your APP to run in VCamera?**  
VCamera is based on a virtual machine, so you can detect whether it is currently running in a virtual machine environment.

Here "isPathReallyExist  < 0" means it running in a virtual machine.  
If "isPathReallyExist = 0" means it running in a real device.
